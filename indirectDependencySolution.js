The solution usually involves carefully examining the dependency tree of your libraries.   Tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help you analyze what dependencies your library uses.  Make sure you install all of them.  If you're using Expo, make sure the libraries are compatible with your managed workflow. In some cases, you might need to link native dependencies manually if the automatic linking fails.  Here's an example showing proper installation and linking of the missing dependency using npm:
```bash
npm install react-native-geolocation-service --save
react-native link react-native-geolocation-service
```
Then, ensure that you correctly import and use the libraries in your components. Always check for any additional instructions provided by the libraries' documentation.
